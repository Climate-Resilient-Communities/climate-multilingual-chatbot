Comprehensive Prompt Injection Vulnerability Testing Suite
=========================================================

This test suite is designed to protect a non-profit climate chatbot from various
prompt injection attacks. It covers a wide spectrum of attack vectors including:
- Direct instruction overrides
- Social engineering approaches  
- Blended legitimate/malicious queries
- Multi-step attack chains
- Known jailbreak techniques
- Document-based injections
- Structured data exploits
- Obfuscation methods
- Persistence and reflection attacks

Author: AI Security Testing Framework
Purpose: Production-grade security validation for climate education chatbot
